Still i look for their beauty

Great cast wasted on a mediocre movie. The story line lacked the thrilling and intricate adventure of the originals. An all-female cast is one of those movies that was produced for the sake of doing a movie. 5/10 #Oceans8

"To all the men out there who didn’t enjoy #Oceans8 and are still talking about it, that is fine. They didn’t make it for you. They made it for us, and that’s ok. It’s a chick flick. You don’t have to like it. You got 3 other movies with the exact same concept, enjoy those."

Finally saw #Oceans8! So fun and funny and great and it confirmed that a lot of the reviews where they complained the characters weren’t distinct just confirm that men can’t tell women apart when we are multicolored and as divergently dressed as birds of paradise.

"Gary Ross revealed that he wanted to include Rihanna songs on #Oceans8 soundtrack, but she opted not to. She wanted no distractions and wanted her fans to see her as this character not her real life persona."
"I LOVED #Oceans8!  It was great fun, easily my fave of the Oceans films. All of the female leads were bloody brilliant. More women-led films, please, Hollywood. And I was totally seduced by #RichardArmitage "
"Ok look, I'm not saying that watching Cate Blanchett in #Oceans8 can solve all our problems, but I'm not NOT saying it... "
Had a lot of fun with #Oceans8! Good afternoon at the movies 
"Men: stop remaking our films.

I love LOVE the foxing album and I'll say this... it doesn't not sound like Portugal The Man gone weird emo
under the redesign it redirects to twitter explore

"It was released September 9, 1997"
my blog became pretty popular in late 2001. i was getting compliments on my writing. i was making connections. i was feeling pretty optimistic about being able to turn blogging into a writing career
"@inthefade I’ve been going back to Foxing’s other albums, very good - particularly enjoying The Albatross."
You were free for a while there
the soundtrack is so much better than the movie
they never made another song as good as this
A lovely script?
"@inthefade Gruden is showing his ass non-stop, isn't he? Good lord, enjoy the season."
But it has everything to do with Nike. And it's Labor Day. ;-)
"nah, you were right, it's on 30 now. i read some false info"

But did she take it as a compliment?

"it's been a long time since i've seen it, but i remember it making me angry"
"welp, almost time to go to bed and lay awake for hours on end thinking about how my parents are starting to fall apart"
Can I substitute kale for the pasta?
this is what i'm worried about. dilaudid is so strong and then to give her oxy on top of it?
left work after an hour because i'm sick. home now and enjoying faith/void's first full length album
"that was the best thing i've read in a while, luke. touching, depressing, profound, made me feel a zillion things"
"Maybe, and FB was really wonky about N hour ago, so speak your piece :)"
"but i came off as angry, sullen and unapproachable. maybe they wanted to talk to me but felt like they couldn't. maybe no one checked in on me privately because i got my quills up and they were intimidated"
Twitter Marshall is IRL Marshall toned down
"Back to LOVE? That's what it was before, we didn't have it on today."
"that lasted not long. i put on the mets game, which is in a rain delay"
"I only know of it because of the fashion blog I follow, and they only cover Noah to mock what she wears, but there is no reason for us to know who she is."
I know it is!  rinky dinks Facebook page

I’m not gonna take shit about constantly listening to the new Foxing album from someone who is hooked on Imagine Dragons
"someone just invited me to join a facebook page for remembering 9/11 and i'm like bitch, are accusing me of forgetting?"
"oh, please. he's holding his hands over his ears so he can't hear anything, that's not being driven off the site"

Pit stop
That’s one beautiful looking friend! Just as good looking as mine when he was a pup
I made a friend
The times they would’ve had.
Just surprised myself by how much I can puke inside my mouth and still swallow it down. Christ is right.
"I didn't turn on the TV set, and I'm not gonna score-watch, but I'd be lying if I told you or anyone else that I didn't check to see if Eli's still playing this morning."
just ordered new boots and i am so excited to wear them
"My mistake, you're right. Idk why all this time it was 91"
Well said.
"Never?! That was only 4 years ago, right?"
My kids love dipping their fried in mayo! Think the first born showed the second and he showed his younger sister!
Assuming it's raw ... I'll allow it. 
I love the 1975 and also fully acknowledge how much they suckish
"i love my father dearly but i feel like fox news has corrupted him, or brainwashed him and it makes me so mad"
i didn't think i really have a type but it would seem now that manny jacinto starting into a glass of blue liquid is my type
TREASON IS THE REASON FOR THE SEASON?
sometimes i get stuck on a song
"oh, calendar. thanks for the reminder that i am NOT going to this tonight."
saw this on FB and got irate. you never cared about nike's practices before and suddenly you care about child labor? no you don't. you're just using it as a cover for being a racist
"what about something whimsical like this, next to/around this existing one?"
Spoke too soon
Almost home!

this is the only good watchdog account
I love the Trentemoller Remix.
But hockey.
"This is exactly opposite of my view.  Hell, they could replace half of Myers-Briggs with ""John"" and ""Paul"" quadrants"
you're not the boss of me

"i mean, he's affecting the outcome of this game because his feelings were hurt"
"this @WildPinkNYC album is going to be what soundtracks my autumn and winter, i can feel it already"
read this.
i am well aware of what it's like to be in a relationship with an addicted person and it's difficult to navigate and it had it take strength for her to leave
was always partial to the SMGs in Borderlands
"sounds i have a visceral reaction to:
the red hot chili peppers
the opening song to the cleveland show
my phone ringing
the voice of the president of the united states of america"
i forgot parquet courts - wide awake.  a very good album
yanks have already played 140 games this season. i feel like it just started. the fact that the season is winding down depresses me
Lower Your Eyelids To Die With The Sun
"been thinking tonight about addiction and how we treat addicts. addiction is a disease, i know you've heard that before but so many people don't believe and they treat addicts like they're inherently flawed"
"favorite albums of 2018 thus far, updated:
foxing - nearer my god
lemon twigs - back to school
faith/void - embrace nothingness
jeff rosenstock  - post
mgmt - little dark age

john prine - the tree of forgiveness"
love this modest mouse song
"if you had to take part in five memes that would inadvertently let people know what the answers to your security questions are, what would they be?"

"lady behind me in line at 7-11, pointing to my tattoos: aren't you worried about what they will look like when you get old?
me: lady, i'm not worried about what happens when i get to be your age"
Burt Reynolds was a fixture of my childhood. He was the ultimate 70s guy. RIP
Mind Blown!
"Good on Nike. Corporations don't often do the good thing. This is a bold move on their part and will likely result in a backlash, and they know that. Kaepernick is a hero to some, anti-hero to others and making him the face of a product at this time is an amazing thing."
A reminder that there should be an air bud hockey movie called two minutes for ruffing
my current chill-out music of choice
The Venn diagram of people blaming Ariana and people that say just stop doing drugs is probably a circle.
people blaming ariana grande for mac miller's overdose: no one is obligated to stay in an unhealthy relationship for fear of the other person's life. you don't owe anyone your mental health
Superchunk record is SOLID. And their live show was amazing. Had never seen them before and loved it
that's my father smiling in the back WHERE DID YOU GET THIS
sorely tempted to make it so i only see replies from people i follow
"according to spotify, me, my daughter and my son are all listening to the foxing album at the same time"
S O O N
i was talking about fitting motion papers into the scanner
Sadly it’s not surprising at all.
"my husband got me into this, so blame him. i understand if you unfollow me now, or call 911 on me"
"matt, this album is SO GOOD."
Love it! I have gotten so close to getting my first (like meeting with the guy about the design) and have chickened out. I need to just do it.
I had that same issue earlier tonight.
I just started bawling at my desk
when someone ranks all of van halen's songs and unchained isn't number one
"Welp, we had a good run."
I don’t know anything about this sentence and I’m ok with that
You’re an idiot.
I hadn’t thought about that. Starbucks. My mail carrier 
"So I've been watching this British whodunit on Netflix called ""River"" that resonates hard with these sentiments & in your following tweets"
"i got news for you, we are ALL inherently flawed in some way. addiction isn't part of that. people who are addicts need your love and attention and help, they don't need your pity or your judgment"
so happy to see lots of hockey stuff on my timeline
"happy for you, it's great to find meds that work"
it's crazy enough that you had this thought in your head but then you went and said it out loud
So sorry for your loss. Peace to you and your family

"ah yes, MILLIONS of people are going cut their already purchased socks up. Nike will be devastated"
I'm guess around three months old? They grow so fast at that age.
Living near water is one of life's pleasures. I love going to the beach when the clouds are low and the water is a slate grey. Thanks for this.
"At a party with a lot of people I don’t know, but the scenery is gorgeous so I won’t complain"
"my father posted one of those nike memes on FB, with nike's words over a picture of one of his best friends, who died on 9/11. i'm angry at him for using his friend like that, and also because he refuses to acknowledge the reason for the protests"
My father had a tattoo from his time in the Navy during WWII. I never gave it a second thought growing up.
Congrats to @david_j_roth for being included in this year’s best american sports writing anthology. Well deserved

"I am tired of tiptoeing around racists, tired of not saying anything because i'm generally non confrontational. I am angry at people AND I WILL FIGHT YOU. if you don't want to talk to me anymore because of my views, BYE."
"Unfortunately it only took a day for @Mamamia to rip off the yarn (and attribute it to the wrong paper). The disrespect shown to the reporter, and more importantly to Kat and her family, by churning such a sensitive story is astounding."
I can’t believe there was a Unite the Right 2. There shouldn’t be as many American nazi marches as there are Mamma Mia movies
