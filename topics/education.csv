Quantity to Quality. #NEP2020 1. Increased focus on foundational literacy and numeracy. 2. Competency based learning 3. Students will be learning how to learn bringing in metacognition 4. Curriculum content reduced to core essentials 5. Emphasis on constructivist
5+3+3+4 structure will definitely bring a paradigm shift! This was much needed. This shirt video explains it well. I think we need more of this to create the awareness. Good one by @HRDMinistry #educationpolicy2020 #NEP2020 
2020 finally moving forward! #Rafale #NEP2020 #RamMandirAyodhya 2020 will remain a historic year not just for #COVID19 but also for the reforms for civilization &amp; #India. Thank you PM @narendramodi ji &amp; all the citizens for your relentless pursuit to revolution.
"It is entirely silent on the question of Kashmiri students whose education is being jeopardized by years of curfew, erratic school closures and general life being traumatized with draconian laws. is education not for kashmiri students? #NationalEducationPolicy2020 #NEP2020"
Why some people are opposing the new National Education Policy and #RejectNEP2020 is Trending? Govt : This is the reason we r changing our education policy. #NEP2020
Sir please publish SSC CGL Tier 3 result.Its been 7 mnths since we appeared for the exam.Even #upsc mains was conducted 15 days after it and final result got published http://today.As admirer of #NEP2020 I hope u will look into this incessant delay from SSC @narendramodi
#NewEducationPolicy #NEP2020 which encourages students to work in latest technologies including Spiritual studies like Yoga &amp; Meditation along with NCC &amp; an education system that promote #AtmaNirbharBharat .
"And these changes point at diverging the economic gap in our nation rather than bridge it, some of it is welcome but most of it is a clear act of discrimination. #NEP2020 #educationpolicy2020 #educationpolicy #education"
The national education policy draft includes no mention of Jammu and Kashmir or any of the North eastern states or how special provisions will be made to include these areas where conflict persists. #NEP2020 #NationalEducationPolicy2020
How is the government aiming to fulfil this digital divide with only proposed 1.86 percent budget increase? What companies have been contacted to fund or subsidise the costs for laptops and mobile phones or tablets and internet connection? #NationalEducationPolicy2020 #NEP2020
"As far as access to education is concerned, only 10 percent of government schools in India have access to computers. Only an abysmal 4 percent of total have internet connectivity. #NEP2020 #NationalEducationPolicy2020"
"In a country where fluency in English is considered a top indicator of merit and subs. as a filter for economic opportunities, students who arent well versed in English wl be robbed of opportunities to escape brutal despondency created by caste and class discrimnation #NEP2020"
"Conveniently this implies that the only students having to incorporate such massive changes in instruction are students from Dalit, Bahujan and Adivasi students whose future is being jeopardized. #NEP2020"
Which predominantly leaves this change to be incorporated by state schools and government schools where the students from marginalized sections and minorities study. #NEP2020
Govt officials have stated that KVs and CBSE schools will not have to incorporate medium of teaching in regional languages as these schools cater to students whose parents are central gov employees with frequent transfer and jump in instruction will be difficult 4 them #NEP2020
The maximum brunt of such de-allocation has been previously borne by social science departments that catered to research on topics such as women’s studies and caste. No detail about the increase in budget with proper allocation and disbursal scheme has been mentioned. #NEP2020
"The gov apparently intends to increase spending on education to 6 % of GDP when under current Modi regime, the edu budget has been reduced from a minimal 4.14% to 3.2% with deductions in scholarships for higher education as well as budget allocations to research dept. #NEP2020"
Why are we not asking the questions of the hour that what is this policy really pointing at. Saffronism in the patronage of this policy #NEP2020 @fayedsouza @msisodia @ShashiTharoor
"#NEP2020 New Curricular and pedagogical structure A new developmentally-appropriate curriculum and pedagogical structure for school education based on principles of brain development and learning has been proposed on a 5 + 3 + 3 + 4 design, covering 4 stages."
The #NEP2020 is the next big thing that would change the nation. I'm feeling jealous.
"And let's think about it, B R Ambedkar wouldn't have made his mark if he never got to learn English and that language gave him the edge that has him (someone who the entire society looked upon as an outcast) be the Father of our Constitution #NEP2020 #educationpolicy2020"
"Keep debating what suits your propaganda madam. Anything related to Sanatan Dharm is regressive and oppressive too for likes of you. However, when this doesn't work, you people chose the Dalit way of attacking Sanatan Dharm indirectly. Keep it up. But, that won't work #NEP2020"
4. You bring in vocational education which is the better term for we will give you a degree in subjects that you can accrue minimal labour from and hence with no English they're just going to be going back 10 year of improvement #NEP2020 @TimesNow @republic
2. Giving state wise control again shifting the demographic and giving it scope of creating political issues 3. You are removing a language which has helped bring uniformity #NEP2020 #NEP
Dear So called #Hindi Fanatics and #Sanskrit extremist.... Kindly Teach Hindi to the people of Uttarpradesh and Bihar… before you trying to impose it on Non Hindi states in the name of #NEP2020 #TNRejectsNEP #புதிய_கல்வி_கொள்கை
Then provide with teachers of these subjects in all government schools then i will support #NEP2020
"The NPE 2020 is power pack strategy for making India a Global leader. I am BHARAT & can speak- Hindi, English and Bhojpuri; yes it's my choice Hope it will be implemented in all possible manners so can reach every corner of BHARAT @DrRPNishank #NEP2020 #NewIndia"
#NEP2020 It should be just fine. 
"#NEP2020 New Education Policy 2020, a detailed analysis for #Students of India. A major #positivechange for the students studying in school &amp; college both. What's in this for you, watch full video on NEP2020 &amp; share this video! https://youtu.be/rHYlD4bqZZI #youthaajkal #NEP2020"
"So many 3rd students have started doing their Masters courses in India and haven't even finished bachelors yet, thanks to the joke @Delhiuniversit has made of our lives. Just give us our degrees already. You are ruining your image. #StudentLivesMatter #cancelallexams #NEP2020"
NEP2020 instead conveniently found a technocratic solution to feed more disposable workers to industries. How does incentivizing the student to undergo vocational training help making students stay back in school to finish education and enter higher edu institutions? #NEP2020
"The policy has not tackled the reason for dropouts, which wasn’t travelling the world or taking gap years but sheer economic despondency forcing students into informal labour. #NEP2020"
"On page 11, the policy states –“ In particular students would continue to have the option of exiting after Grade 10 and re-entering in the next phase to pursue vocational or any other courses available in Grades 11- 12, incl at a more specialized school, if so desired.” #NEP2020"
The emphasis on vocational training with multiple exit options is nothing but a material assertion of the caste system. Can dropout rates even be curtailed if the government is incentivizing dropouts by providing multiple exit options? #NEP2020
Students from upper caste can rely on network and social capital to attain opportunities even if they are not meritorious in board exams. The solution to this isn’t a superficial consolation in words but increase in economic opportunities and employment. #NEP2020
"In response to shrinking economic opportunities, cut throat competition arises which becomes an additional burden for students from marginalzied communities who also have to face the brunt of caste and class discrimination. #NationalEducationPolicy2020 #NEP2020"
"Shrinking of emphasis on board exams aims to relieve exam pressure but misses entire reasons for this stress on students from marginalized communities. Unemployment in India is at a record 23.5% as of July 2020,recruitment in public sector reducing low. #NEP2020"
"Neither is there a systemic critique of the caste systems’ involvement with education and its persistent presence within the education sector, nor is there any allocation of funds to decrease inequities in caste. #NationalEducationPolicy2020 #NEP2020"
"In the sixty six page document the word caste is mentioned only six times, most of which are cursory mentions. The policy uses declining caste based representation in education as a burden on the government’s developing nation agenda. #NationalEducationPolicy2020 #NEP2020"
"These enrollment drop offs are more severe for Scheduled Tribes students (10.6% to 6.8%), and differently-abled children (1.1% to 0.25%), with even greater declines for female students within each of these categories”- NEP 2020, pg. 25. #NationalEducationPolicy2020 #NEP2020"
"According to U-DISE 2016-17 data, about 19.6% of students belong to Scheduled Castes at the primary level, but this fraction falls to 17.3% at the higher secondary level. #NationalEducationPolicy #NEP2020"
"NEP 2020 intends to redesign pedagogical structure and promote creative thinking. Despite its assumed objective, policy seems to have lost connection with ground realities of education, indulging rather in deceptive progressive politics. #NationalEducationPolicy2020 #NEP2020"
NCC should be mandatory in all school -> For Discipline Life Inclusion of Traffic rules and Road Discipline in Syllabus -> For Safe Life Inclusion of Disaster Mgnt with Practical Exercises -> For Safety & Precaution #NEP2020 #NewEducationPolicy2020 @HRDMinistry @DrRPNishank

"#SDG4 #equitable #NEP2020 universal access to high quality ECCE across India. Priority to socio-economically disadvantaged locations. Anganwadis, Ashramshalas being brought in the purview. Large-scale advocacy."
Students of arts and humanities will aim to learn more science and all (institutions including engineering institutes) will make an effort to incorporate more vocational subjects and soft skills. One of the many lines I liked in the new education policy. #NEP2020
#NationalEducationPolicy #NEP2020 can be game changer if implemented properly with adequate checks. Need for fixed accountability from teachers to school necessary at every stage. loopholes in accountability sld be removed with regular reviews every 2 years from feedback.
Our Play2Learn Program aligns with the #NEP2020 that lays emphasis on play-based learning as a crucial part of Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE). Our Play Sessions are designed to support children’s academics and build their holistic development.

"Is #NEP2020 reflective of the rural-urban divide? NEP has included 'coding' as one of the skills it wants to inculcate in students. My niece who just entered middle school is vying to do a course herself. So, NEP is somewhat reflective of the nextgen's aspiration."

The States get nearly half their revenues of over ₹30 lakh crore from SGST (20 per cent) and Central tax transfers (27 per cent) (@RBI). Both of which are expected to affect due to COVID-19. Not that situation of center-state finances was better before the pandemic hit. #NEP2020
Yes! State govts also spend on education as a concurrent subject but their revenue streams are limited after GST was introduced. @nipfp_org_in analysis shows almost all states in India are already underspending on education. Who will fund #NEP2020 ? 
The above numbers are just about financial commitments needed annually to fulfill outcomes related to RTE/ Free elementary education. We have to also consider funds for: Secondary education Higher education Vocational courses #NEP2020
So let's make 10 languages compulsory in all schools #NEP2020 #TNRejectsNEP With so much advancements in Artificial Intelligence the language barrier is no at all an issue. Understand NEP is not just for 2020 it is for next 20-30 yrs. (1/2)

"Before thrusting #NEP2020 on kids, let all the BJP MPs and MLAs take tests in Sanskrit, Hindi and English, including the sinister architect Kasturirangan and share their marks out in the open. I am sure they won't even score the minimum marks to make it to the cut. #TNRejectsNEP"

The #NEP2020 does not mandate Hindi (the draft last year seemed to). Tamil Nadu should embrace it and work with other states to strengthen state languages by teaching them in one another's schools. But that would require a forward-thinking government.

TN rejects three language system. Now next serious problem is All India Entrance exam for all higher education. Because having different syllabus in each part of India each student will be studying different ones. And common exam is simply unjust to those students. #NEP2020
